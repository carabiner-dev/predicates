# Policy Material Predicates

This repository contains wrappers around the 🔴🟡🟢 [AMPEL](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/ampel)
[policy material](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/policy) elements to implement
the [Carabiner Attestation Framework](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/attestation)
interfaces.

This repository is designed to be minimal and the module hosted here is intended
to be used only by programs that want to treat Policies or Results as
attestations following the [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) compatible carabiner tools.
